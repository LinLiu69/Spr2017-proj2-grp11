### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Post project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals.

Summary: We help our user explore the trend of international trade of coffee, tea, chocolate, cocoa and spices(all belong to the same subgroup in Customs) and look into the reason of up-and-downs of trade value. We do that by presenting our data and results interactively: trade relationships are displayed on 3D globe, 2D map with different countries' news link and a series of statistical plots.
