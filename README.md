In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on US international trade using U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website. See [Project 2 Description](project2_desc.md) for more details.  

Data Source: [data.gov](http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/country/sitc/index.html).

+ **Project summary**: In this cool project, we aim to help our user explore the trend of international trade of coffee, tea, chocolate, cocoa and spices(all belong to the same subgroup in Customs)and look into the reason of up-and-downs of trade value. We do that by presenting our data and results interactively: trade relationships are displayed on 3D globe, 2D map with different countries' news link and a series of statistical plots. 

+ **Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
